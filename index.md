## Currently

I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher in [Annalise Paaby](http://genaamics.org)'s lab in [Georgia Tech](http://www.gatech.edu/)'s Biological Sciences department. My work here concentrates on elicudating the genetic mechanisms that allow the development of stable phenotypes to drift over evolutionary time (a.k.a. Developmental System Drift).
